## Final Project - Non-immigrant Data Science workforce in the US 2011-2016

My application will use H1-B visa data from Department of Labor (DOI) to draw an overall picture of non-immigrant workforce in data science area from 2011 - 2016. H1-B visa is a temporary employment-based visa granted to non-US citizen individuals who are hired for specialty occupations that require special skillset and ability. Only 65,000 visas are granted each year to qualified professionals and this analysis will explore the relationship among different features in the dataset leading to case final decision. 

Refer to my project statement for more details about this project.
